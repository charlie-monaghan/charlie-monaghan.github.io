                    Film has surprised me as I began to explore it as of late. The physicality of a film set when compared to the digital landscape of other mediums of creation facinates me. From setting up lights, to
                    fiddling with camera settings and placements, even to the acting within it are very fun to me and I feel that this is reflected in the quality of my work. For "The Florida Creature Feature" I was in charge of most of
                    the pre-production, a good chunk of the production sections, and audio recording for post-production. For example: story formulation, reference gathering, some script writing, portraying The Florida Creature, and recording
                    voicovers and foley. All in all the entire experience was fascinating, and it was super fun to be part of a team that made such an incredibly funny story. Alongside this, I've also experimented with compositing and post
                    editing in Premiere Pro, which are shown along side "The Florida Creature Feature." I find it difficult but interesting to take raw footage and transform it into something else entirely, and am looking forward to improving
                    my skills in the area.
