                    RUNK is my first ever experience in game development and programming. Overall, I think it was an enormous help in exposing me to the various angles of game development, and the different paths that I could
                    have chosen to take. Through the help of a package of starter scripts and art assets found online, I was able to create a story that I found interesting, which is explored through the character interactions
                    and exploring the stage. Creating the logic for the two gambling games, Higher Lower and Slots, was an interesting challenge as a first time user of Unity and it's Scripting.

                    Unhanged Man is a metroidvania roguelike game that I worked on with a team of four other of my collegues. This was my first experience in collaborative game development and version control, and I value it highly
                    for the knowledge that it gave me. In the end, I was responsible for the managers, data tracking between scenes, the weapon and items system, a lot of UI, and other various systems. Seeing as our team was
                    rather small, we each had a hand in all of the systems either way, which was a valuable learning experience. For more information about the game specifically, visit my itch.io page for more details.

                    This small project was my first real dive into 3D Unity projects and First Person gameplay. I used Unity's terrain tool to create an arena, and Unity's built in player controller as the basis for the player.
                    I then found free assets for the targets and the weapons, got them working, and then scripted everything else based on various tutorials. I learned a lot about "inventory" systems, raycasts and their uses
                    in FPS games, and how to handle object instantiation and destruction. Overall, this project was a good first experience into 3D and first person development.
