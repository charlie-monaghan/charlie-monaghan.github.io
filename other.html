                        Featured below are some of my other works and projects that don't quite fit neatly under game development. While game development is my main focus, interdisciplinary study is important for being well rounded and
                        proficient in all areas of life. As such, the various programs I have experience in or have used at some point are listed. Out of all I have done, film, motion design/animation, and UI/UX have been the most enjoyable.
                        While traditional and digital art and animation are not necessarily my strong suit, I've still tried my hand at it to some success.

                    While my focus does remain on film and game design, I feel that these animation projects should be showcased nonetheless. Working in ToonBoom's Harmony gave a significant learning curve. Peg-based animation was
                    daunting at first, but I've come to the understanding of just how easy it eventually makes the whole process. For the "World's Strongest Man" animation, I made and rigged the entire character, drew the stage and props based off
                    references, and then finally animated the entire thing. If I'm to honest, the actual animation, i.e. te posing and keyframing, was actually pretty enjoyable. However the drawing and rigging were rather difficult and not that
                    enjoyable. Overall, however, I'm still proud of the final product and am glad I got to experience the animation pipeline.

                    Spending time around cameras in film has inevitably led me towards trying my hand at photography too. After learning the basics of cinematography and how to manipulate the camera to do what you want, experiementing
                    with photography comes as a very familiar experience. While I don't personally own a camera other than my phone to take photos with, I rented a camera out for a weekend and took some photos on a nature walk in the
                    Gainesville Sweetwater Nature Preserve, which provided me with a wide range of subject matter to practice on, the best of which are featured just above.
