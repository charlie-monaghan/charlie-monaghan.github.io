                <p class="profile">Featured below are some of my other works and projects that don't quite fit neatly under game development. While game development is my main focus, interdisciplinary study is important for being well rounded and 
                proficient in all areas of life. As such, the various programs I have experience in or have used at some point are listed. Out of all I have done, film, motion design/animation, and UI/UX have been the most enjoyable. 
                While traditional and digital art and animation are not necessarily my strong suit, I've still tried my hand at it to some success.</p>

                <p class="gallery">While I certainly do not claim to be an artist, I feel that these animation projects should be showcased nonetheless. Working in ToonBoom's Harmony gave a significant learning curve. Peg-based animation was 
                daunting at first, but I've come to the understanding of just how easy it eventually makes the whole process. For the "World's Strongest Man" animation, I rigged the entire character, drew the stage and props based off 
                references, and then finally animated the entire thing. If I'm to honest, the actual animation, i.e. te posing and keyframing, was actually pretty enjoyable. However the drawing and rigging were rather difficult and not that 
                enjoyable. Overall, however, I'm still proud of the final product and am glad I got to experience the animation pipeline.</p>

                    Film has surprised me as I began to explore it as of late. The physicality of a film set when compared to the digital landscape of other mediums of creation facinates me. From setting up lights, to
                    fiddling with camera settings and placements, even to the acting within it are very fun to me and I feel that this is reflected in the quality of my work. For "The Florida Creature Feature" I was in charge of most of
                    the pre-production, a good chunk of the production sections, and audio recording for post-production. For example: story formulation, reference gathering, some script writing, portraying The Florida Creature, and recording
                    voicovers and foley. All in all the entire experience was fascinating, and it was super fun to be part of a team that made such an incredibly funny story. Alongside this, I've also experimented with compositing and post
                    editing in Premiere Pro, which are shown along side "The Florida Creature Feature." I find it difficult but interesting to take raw footage and transform it into something else entirely, and am looking forward to improving
                    my skills in the area.

                    Spending time around cameras in film has inevitably led me towards trying my hand at photography too. After learning the basics of cinematography and how to manipulate the camera to do what you want, experiementing 
                    with photography comes as a very familiar experience. While I don't personally own a camera other than my phone to take photos with, I rented a camera out for a weekend and took some photos on a nature walk in the 
                    Gainesville Sweetwater Nature Preserve, which provided me with a wide range of subject matter to practice on, the best of which are featured just above.
