                <h1>Non-Game Development Projects</h1>
                <p class="profile">Featured below are some of my other projects that don't quite fit neatly under game development. While game development is my main focus, interdisciplinary study is important for being well rounded and 
                proficient in all areas of life. As such, the various programs I have experience in or have used at some point are listed. Out of all I have done, film, motion design/animation, and UI/UX have been the most enjoyable. 
                While traditional and digital art and animation are not necessaryily my strong suit, I've still tried my hand at it to some success.</p>
