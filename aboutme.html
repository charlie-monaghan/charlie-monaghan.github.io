        <div id="aboutme">
            <p>I am a 19 year old college student, as previously mentioned, in my first semester of a Digital Arts and Sciences major. I was born in Tampa, Florida, and lived here for about 10 years before moving up to Mount Pleasant, South Carolina fo about a year and a half, and then Wilmington, North Carolina for about 9 months before finally moving back down to Lake Mary, Florida since. I've always been into computers, coding, and video games, building my first computer when I was like 11, and eventually I came to UF, initally with a computer science degree. I realized about halfway through the semester that Comp Sci was lame and discovered the Digital Worlds Institute.</p>
