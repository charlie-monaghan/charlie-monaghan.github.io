                    RUNK is my first ever experience in game development and programming. Overall, I think it was an enormous help in exposing me to the various angles of game development, and the different paths that I could
                    have chosen to take. Through the help of a package of starter scripts and art assets found online, I was able to create a story that I found interesting, which is explored through the character interactions
                    and exploring the stage. Creating the logic for the two gambling games, Higher Lower and Slots, was an interesting challenge as a first time user of Unity and it's Scripting.

                    Unhanged Man is a metroidvania roguelike game that I worked on with a team of four other of my collegues. This was my first experience in collaborative game development and version control, and I value it highly
                    for the knowledge that it gave me. In the end, I was responsible for the managers, data tracking between scenes, the weapon and items system, a lot of UI, and other various systems. Seeing as our team was
                    rather small, we each had a hand in all of the systems either way, which was a valuable learning experience. For more information about the game specifically, visit my itch.io page for more details.
